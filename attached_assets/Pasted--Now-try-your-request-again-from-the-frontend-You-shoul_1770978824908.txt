
● Now try your request again from the frontend. You should get a clearer error
  message that tells you exactly what's wrong. The error message will now show:

  1. If session doesn't exist: {"error": "Session not found", "sessionId": 
  "...", "message": "Please create a session first using POST /api/sessions"}
  2. If validation fails: {"error": "Validation failed", "details": [array of 
  specific validation errors]}

  Can you try again and share:
  1. The exact error message you get
  2. The session ID your frontend is using
  3. Whether you created a session first

  Also, make sure your frontend:
  1. First calls POST /api/sessions to create a session
  2. Saves the returned session.id
  3. Then calls POST /api/sessions/:id/snapshots with that saved session ID

  Example flow:
  // Step 1: Create session
  const sessionResponse = await
  fetch('https://luciuslab.xyz:4009/api/sessions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      selectedLift: "flat-bench",
      goal: "strength",
      profile: { /* ... */ }
    })
  });
  const { session } = await sessionResponse.json();
  const sessionId = session.id;  // SAVE THIS!

  // Step 2: Add snapshots using the session ID
  const snapshotsResponse = await
  fetch(`https://luciuslab.xyz:4009/api/sessions/${sessionId}/snapshots`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      snapshots: [ /* your snapshots */ ]
    })
  });

snapshots

● I see the issue - you're sending the correct format. Let me check if there's
  a validation issue with the exact data. Can you share the complete request
  including what session ID you're using?

  Let me test with your exact data to see what's failing:

● Bash(curl -X POST 'https://luciuslab.xyz:4009/api/sessions/8adff0c1-6318-4124-a61
      e-12afdfc194ac/snapshots' \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \…)
  ⎿  < HTTP/1.1 200 OK                    
     < Server: nginx/1.24.0 (Ubuntu)
     < Date: Fri, 13 Feb 2026 10:30:07 GMT
     … +3 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● The request works perfectly! ✅ It returned 200 OK.

  The issue is that your frontend is using a session ID that doesn't exist.

  Can you check:

  1. Open your browser console and look at the Network tab
  2. Find the failed request to /snapshots
  3. Look at the URL - what session ID is it using?
  4. Did you create a session first?

  The problem is likely one of these:

  ❌ Frontend is using a hardcoded/old session ID
  ❌ Session creation failed but frontend didn't handle the error
  ❌ Session ID is not being saved correctly

  Can you share your frontend code that:
  1. Creates the session
  2. Saves the session ID
  3. Sends the snapshots request

  Or share a screenshot of the Network tab showing both the session creation
  request and the snapshots request?
