    "message": "Based on your strength profile, I have a few specific questions to help diagnose your limiting factors:\n\n**1.** Your Overhead Press at 135 lbs is 60% of your Flat Bench Press at 225 lbs, which is on the lower end of the expected 60-70%. Do you find that the bar slows down significantly in the early mid-range phase (2-6 inches off the chest), suggesting a possible shoulder involvement issue?\n\n**2.** Given that we don't have your Close-Grip Bench Press data, can you share if you experience any specific difficulties during the lockout phase of your bench press? This could help determine if tricep strength is a limiting factor.\n\n**3.** When performing the Flat Bench Press, do you feel that you struggle more with initiating the lift off the chest, or is it more challenging to maintain the bar path and speed through the mid-range? Your feedback will help identify if the issue is more related to chest strength or technical breakdown.\n\nPlease answer these questions - they'll help me identify exactly what's holding back your progress.",
    "analysis": "Based on the user's strength snapshot, their Flat Bench Press is at 225 lbs for 5 reps, and their Overhead Press is at 135 lbs for 5 reps. The Overhead Press is approximately 60% of their Flat Bench Press, which is within the expected range of 60-70%. This suggests that their shoulder strength is adequately developed relative to their bench press. However, without additional accessory lift data such as Close-Grip Bench Press or Incline Bench Press, it's challenging to pinpoint specific weaknesses in the triceps or upper chest. Given the typical sticking points in the bench press and the absence of specific accessory lift data, we might hypothesize a potential issue in the chest strength off the bottom position or tricep lockout strength. Furthermore, the Overhead Press being on the lower end of the expected range might indicate that the anterior deltoids could be a limiting factor in the transition phase of the bench press."
